 Polygon is a python package that handles polygonal shapes in 2D. It contains
 Python bindings for gpc, the excellent General Polygon Clipping Library by
 Alan Murta and some extensions written in C and pure Python. With Polygon you
 may handle complex polygonal shapes in Python in a very intuitive way. Polygons
 are simple Python objects, clipping operations are bound to standard operators
 like +, -, \|, & and ^. TriStrips can be constructed from Polygons with a
 single statement. Functions to compute the area, center point, convex hull,
 point containment and much more are included. This package was already used to
 process shapes with more than one million points!

 The gpc homepage is located at http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby/alan/software/ .
 .
 The wrapping and extension code is free software, but the core gpc library is
 free for non-commercial usage only. The author says:
